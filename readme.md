Old readme:

# Best Metal Albums

Determine what metal albums [Encyclop√¶dia Metallum][em] considers the best.

## Usage

Install dependencies:

    npm i

Download all the band URLs:

    npm run get-band-urls

Get all the band data:

    npm run get-bands

That's throttled and will a metric shit-ton of time to download. If you're just
interested in analysing the data it's best if you get it from some other place.
